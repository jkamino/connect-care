A donation platform for collecting funds quickly in the event of a disaster.

## description

Our application leverages Web3 and AI technologies to create a platform for quickly gathering donations during emergencies such as natural disasters.

While donation schemes utilizing Web3 technology have existed in the past, they have often been difficult for inexperienced individuals to use and challenging to set up quickly. With the use of AI technology, our application makes it easy for people with limited experience to set up a donation website quickly. Additionally, the use of Web3 technology enhances the transparency of donation management.

Join us in making a positive impact on the world by using our application to support those affected by disasters.
